    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
    <p>The purpose of Video Game Presence is giving the viewer the experience of massive game companies trying to sell
        games as a service. These companies try to lure and trap people into their games, keeping them in a never-ending
        desire to keep playing the game. This is achieved through various strategies like microtransactions and daily
        reward systems. These games take the spotlight, leaving smaller games that aren't live service games a smaller
        chance to really shine. This leads to a decrease in potential innovation of new video games and new experiences
        for players. The desire to return to a game can be so strong that it can cause people to spend unhealthy amounts
        of time playing these games and prioritizing the game too much. This site gives viewers a simple experience of
        big games hogging the spotlight and finding smaller but also beautiful games that require more effort to find
        them. In the creation of this archive, we utilized imagery that is associated with each individual game in a
        strategic manner. The live service games that take the spotlight of the non-live service games are purposefully
        displayed with a large image, while the non-live service games are hidden away behind a drop down and with a
        smaller image. The size of the image and easiness of discovery are correlated to the popularity of the game,
        critiquing the disproportionate attention for games and the exploitation from live service games. Overall, we
        believe that the archive accurately represents the prioritization in advertisement of games within the video
        game industry.
