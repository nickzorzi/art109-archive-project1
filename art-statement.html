    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
    <p>The purpose of Video Game Presence is giving the viewer the experience of massive game companies trying to sell games as a service.
        These companies try to lure and trap people into their games, keeping them in a never-ending desire to keep playing the game. This is 
        achieved through various strategies like microtransactions and daily reward systems. These games take the spotlight, leaving smaller
        games that aren't live service games a smaller chance to really shine. This leads to a decrease in potential innovation of new video games
        and new experiences for players. The desire to return to a game can be so strong even that it can cause people to spend unhealthly amounts
        of time playing these games and prioritizing the game too much. This site gives viewers a simple experience of big games hogging the spotlight
        and finding smaller but also beautiful games requires more effort to find them.
